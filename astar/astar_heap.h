/*
 * This defines one square in the grid, and is the binary heap's payload. It
 * maintains f, g, and h values for a grid square.
 *
 * We also maintain a bitfield that stores compactly the necessary flags to
 * represent this square.
 *
 * The base cost to move onto this square stored as a 0-255 value. A value of
 * 255 means the square is completely inaccessible and will never be
 * considered. Values below that are added to the cost of moving onto the
 * square so that more 'expensive' moves can be avoided.
 *
 * The direction stored is towards the square's parent in the solution --
 * i.e. from the END of the path towards the BEGINNING. Must be reversed when a
 * route is found. The path proper is obtained at the end of the processing and
 * is stored piecemeal in square_t.rdir.
